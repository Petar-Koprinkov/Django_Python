Studying to become a teacher, he taught for a year in 1895 in his native village. He went to Sofia some time after that, and from 1898 to 1900 returned to live in Bailovo. He was first published in 1901, and the respect it earned him in literary circles encouraged him to go to Sofia in 1903, where he worked as a librarian at the Sofia University library and national library of Bulgaria from 1904. From 1922 he was a curator of the Ivan Vazov museum. His name was derived from a Bulgarian folksong. He spent 1904â€“05 in France, and made trips to Italy and Russia in 1906 and 1913. Most of his life was spent in Sofia.",
